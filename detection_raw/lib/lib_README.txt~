The file libfreenect.so.0.1 is just a link to the libfreenect.so file, which is the library needed for interaction with the kinect.
The libfreenect.so file is needed at compile time, and the Makefile will search for it.
On execution time, the program will search for libfreenect.so.0.1, which could just be a renamed libfreenect.so, or a link to it
except it searches through the Linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so the link included in the lib folder is just there for an example
